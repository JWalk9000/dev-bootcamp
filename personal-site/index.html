      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article>
        <p>My name is Jesse, I am an aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for building useful things. I have a background in construction and have recently transitioned into the tech industry.</p>
      </article>
        <p>From the first use of my grandparents Apple 2 that they had for their business in the mid 80s, I have loved computers and the things that can be created with them. Until I became an adult I didnt really have the financial ability to have anything modern, or invest in school to learn how to create a career with computers. Instead, from an early age I started working in construction, and construction related industries as everthing from a laborer to the foreman running huge crews, trying to follow the money and stick to my morals and values. On multiple occasions I ended up leaving companies that didn't adhear to their own levels of professed standards. Fast forward to 2022, after nearly 30 years of this, and after leaving another company that outwardly appeared to take care of and value their employees, but internally treated them(us) like indentured slaves, I had had enough, it was time for a change.</p>
      <article>
        <p>I had taken some cheap and free online courses to learn some python, I have been a hobby user of Linux for over 20 years, and I have always been a tinkerer, so I decided to take any job I could find that would allow me to work on computers. I landed a job as a hardware field service technician with a POS hardware and service company, which has been a great start. In my down time between jobs I have been working on expanding my technical knowledge of networking, Docker, Server Administration, and working on my own personal projects.</p>

For contractors who provide services like Pool maintenance, janitorial, lawn care, etc. Giving the customer a way to see when their service is scheduled, what has been done on the service call, and a way to communicate with the technician. This project has not begun development yet. It will have a focus on creating a solid foundation for future features with clear easy to follow documentation for expansion through custom modules for a given service industry. The goal is to create a platform that can be used by any service industry, with the ability to customize it for specific needs of that industry.
